## This is just a speculation. Nothing here is confirmed.

# Problem

indev2 can only load one mod at a time.


# Solution

Make a mod loader.


# How?

Mod Loader is gonna be a single mod which will be initially loaded by indev2 - then, Mod Loader will load all the mods user specified.


# What we do I guess
## Warning! The next part of readme is complete bullshit

Step 1: come up with the ideas for how it actually works
 - Location of ideas: TODO #3 make location

Step 2: pseudocode
 - or not

Step 3: code
 - have to wait until the beta
